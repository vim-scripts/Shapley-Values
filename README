This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3178

The script provides tools to compute:
Shapley Value (also using Ieong-Shoham rules) of a Normal form game,
McQuillin-Shapley value
Pham-Do-Norde-Shapley value 
Meyrson-Shapley values                (all three for games in partition form, i.e. with externalities)
